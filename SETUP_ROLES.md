# Role-Based Access Control Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up secure, role-based access control for Spectrum CRM using Firebase Auth custom claims and Firestore security rules.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### 1. Apply Firestore Security Rules
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: `spectrum-crm-114-v1`
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** â†’ **Rules**
4. Copy the rules from `FIRESTORE_RULES.md` and paste them
5. Click **Publish**

### 2. Set Up Admin Tools
```bash
cd tools
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Service Account
1. In Firebase Console, go to **Project Settings** â†’ **Service Accounts**
2. Click **Generate new private key**
3. Save the JSON file securely
4. Set environment variable:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account-key.json"
```

### 4. Find User UIDs
First, sign in to your CRM application with the Google accounts you want to assign roles to. Then check Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ Users to get their UIDs.

### 5. Update setClaims.js
Edit `tools/setClaims.js` and replace the placeholder UIDs:
```javascript
const users = [
  { 
    uid: "YOUR_ACTUAL_ADMIN_UID", 
    email: "admin@yourdomain.com",
    role: "admin"
  },
  { 
    uid: "YOUR_ACTUAL_FRONTDESK_UID", 
    email: "frontdesk@yourdomain.com",
    role: "frontdesk"
  },
  // Add more users as needed
];
```

### 6. Set User Roles
```bash
cd tools
node setClaims.js
```

### 7. Test the System
1. Users may need to sign out and back in for claims to take effect
2. Check that role is displayed in the topbar: "Admin: user@email.com"
3. Test that role-based access works as expected

## ðŸ“‹ User Roles

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **admin** | System administrator | Full access to all data and features |
| **frontdesk** | Front desk staff | Can read all data, write to leads |
| **marketing** | Marketing team | Can read campaigns, limited write access |

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

### Collection-Level Permissions

| Collection | Admin | Frontdesk | Marketing |
|------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **users** | Read/Write | Read only | Read only |
| **leads** | Read/Write | Read/Write | Read only |
| **pricing** | Read/Write | Read only | Read only |
| **vendors** | Read/Write | Read only | Read only |
| **inventory** | Read/Write | Read only | Read only |
| **campaigns** | Read/Write | Read only | Read only |
| **revenue** | Read/Write | No access | No access |

### Frontend Integration

The application automatically detects user roles:
- **Global Variables**: `window.userRole` and `window.currentUser`
- **UI Updates**: Role displayed in topbar
- **Access Control**: Dashboards respect role permissions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for insufficient permissions

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Permission denied" errors:**
- Ensure Firestore rules are published
- Check that user has correct custom claims
- User may need to sign out and back in

**"Admin SDK not initialized":**
- Verify GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is set correctly
- Ensure service account has required permissions

**Claims not updating:**
- Custom claims can take up to 1 hour to propagate
- Force refresh by signing out and back in
- Check claims in Firebase Console â†’ Authentication

### Verification Commands

```bash
# List all users and their UIDs
cd tools
node -e "
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
admin.initializeApp();
admin.auth().listUsers().then(result => {
  result.users.forEach(user => console.log(user.email, user.uid));
});
"

# Check specific user's claims
node -e "
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
admin.initializeApp();
admin.auth().getUser('USER_UID').then(user => {
  console.log('Claims:', user.customClaims);
});
"
```

## ðŸ”„ Adding New Users

1. User signs in to CRM application via Google OAuth
2. Find their UID in Firebase Console â†’ Authentication
3. Add them to the `users` array in `tools/setClaims.js`
4. Run `node setClaims.js`
5. User signs out and back in to receive new permissions
